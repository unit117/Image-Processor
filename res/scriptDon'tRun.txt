This is an example of running the Image Processor main method.

First, you need to type in:

    load-other res/png/city.png c

You need to load the file first, and it can be any file in the res folder, in this case
it is the city.png file, which is in the png folder in the res folder, and we renamed it city.

Then, you need to type in:

    blur city cityBlurred

At this point you can call any function from the menu, this is an example. We blurred it and called
it cityBlurred. You can save here to look at the image, but you can also keep going.

You can also do:

    sepia cityBlurred cityBlurSepia

This means we can take the cityBlurred image and rename it to cityBlurSepia, and we just added the blur and
the sepia filters on the city.png image. You can save here to look at the image, but you can also keep going.

Next, you can type:

    sharpen cityBlurSepia cityBlurSepiaSharp

This will make a sharpened image of the already blurred and sepia-ed image using the matrix and
rename cityBlurSepiaSharp. You can save here to look at the image, but you can also keep going.

Then, you can type:

    new-luma cityBlurSepiaSharp cityBlurSepiaSharpLuma

This will add the luma effect on the already altered image. You can save here to look at the image,
but you can also keep going.

Finally, you can type:

    save-other res/png/newCity.ppm cityBlurSepiaSharpLuma

This should save what we just created in and call it by the given name (newCity). You can navigate to
the res folder and then the png folder








This is an example of running the Image Processor main method.

First, you need to type in:

    load res/test.ppm 2x2

You need to load the file first, and it can be any file in the res folder, in this case
it is the test.ppm file, and we renamed it 2x2.

Then, you need to type in:

    vertical-flip 2x2 2x2Flipped

At this point you can call any function from the menu, this is an example. We flipped it and called
it 2x2Flipped.

You can also do:

    brighten 2x2Flipped 2x2Brighter 10

This means we can take the 2x2Flipped image and rename it to 2x2Brighter and we just made each pixel
increase by a value of 10.

Next, you can type:

    red-component 2x2Brighter 2x2Red

This will make a greyscale of the image using the red component and call it 2x2Red.

Next, you can type:

    horizontal-flip 2x2Red 2x2Horizontal

This will take the previous image and horizontally flip.

Next, you can type:

    blue-component 2x2Horizontal 2x2Blue

This will apply the blue-component greyscale on the image before.

Next, you can type:

    green-component 2x2Blue 2x2Green

This will apply the blue-component greyscale on the image before.

Next, you can type:

    value 2x2Green 2x2Value

This will apply the value greyscale on the image before.

Next, you can type:

    intensity 2x2Value 2x2Intense

This will apply the intensity greyscale on the image before.

Next, you can type:

    luma 2x2Intense 2x2Luma

This will apply the luma effect on the image before.

Finally, you can type:

    save res/alteredImage.ppm 2x2Luma

This should save what we just created and call it by the given name (alteredImage).


You can use this on any image and save at any time.
