This is an example of running the Image Processor main method.

First, you need to type in:

    load res/test.ppm 2x2

You need to load the file first, and it can be any file in the res folder, in this case
it is the test.ppm file, and we renamed it 2x2.

Then, you need to type in:

    vertical-flip 2x2 2x2Flipped

At this point you can call any function from the menu, this is an example. We flipped it and called
it 2x2Flipped.

You can also do:

    brighten 2x2Flipped 2x2Brighter 10

This means we can take the 2x2Flipped image and rename it to 2x2Brighter and we just made each pixel
increase by a value of 10.

Next, you can type:

    red-component 2x2Brighter 2x2Red

This will make a greyscale of the image using the red component and call it 2x2Red.

Finally, you can type:

    save res/2x2Red.ppm 2x2New

This should save what we just created in the hashmap and call it by the given name (2x2New).
